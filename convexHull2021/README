    USER GUIDE:

    This program is used to calculate basic properties of a convex
    hull and to build a surface and volume voxelisation of a convex
    hull. It is executed by running ./HullAnalysis in a terminal.
    
    It uses a binary input file containing points in three 
    dimensions, where the first integer in the file represents the
    number of points N in the file, and then N long doubles follow
    containing those points. The program also uses a binary input 
    file produced by the 2019 SVI project that calculates a convex
    hull from a set of points. That project uses the same binary 
    point file that is used here, and outputs a binary file
    containing the indices of the points in that list that are used
    in the convex hull. This file contains an integer M indicating 
    the number of indices in the file, followed by M integers
    representing all these indices. Each triple of indices represents
    a triangle.

    The output is two text files containing data on the basic
    properties of a convex hull and the comparison with a second
    convex hull, and two binary files with a surface and volume
    voxelisation. The content of these binary files is described
    in our paper.

    The input files can be given directly when the program asks for 
    a file or by giving the names as arguments when running the
    program following the syntax:
    ./HullAnalysis.exe PointsInput IndexInput BasicPropertiesOutput
    SurfaceVoxelisationOutput VolumeVoxelisationOutput
    ComparisonPointsInput ComparisonIndexInput ComparisonOutput
    An example could be:
    ./HullAnalysis.exe TestInput/sphere-points TestInput/sphere-indices 
    TestOutput/BasicProperties TestOutput/SurfaceVoxelisation 
    TestOutput/VolumeVoxelisation TestInput/sphere-points 
    TestInput/sphere-indices TestOutput/ComparisonData

    When making changes to the source code, the project can be
    compiled using a c compiler, for example executing the command
    clang main.c -o HullAnalysis -fopenmp
    OR   
    gcc main.c -o HullAnalysis -fopenmp
    or you can run the provided compileHullAnalysis.bat
